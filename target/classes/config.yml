Plot:
  # How far apart each game plot should be from its neighbor (in blocks).
  Margin: 1000

  # How big each plot will be. 50 blocks will have a 50x50 plot of land per game.
  # lowering this number will lower the amount of time needed before each start of a game.
  Size: 50

  # How many plots (or lobbies) are there at a time.
  # THIS IS THE AMOUNT OF PLOTS **ACROSS** (meaning if this is 5, that means 5x5 = 25 total plots)
  # Lowering this helps very weak servers stay alive lmao (but only when lobbies are at MAX CAPACITY).
  Amount: 5

Server:
  # This tells how long this plugin is allowed to process each tick. This is a workload distro.
  # Lowering this number will increase the amount of time needed to generate a game.
  #
  # Lower this number if your server begins to lag **when making a new game** .
  # Increase this number if server does not lag but waiting time is too long for a game to start.
  # MAX VALUE IS 1000
  MAX_MILLIS_PER_TICK: 10
